| [Calm and Quiet Thunder]  | Replaces the vanilla thunder with calmer and quieter sounds.                         |
| [Not so Shiny Glint]      | Makes the enchantment glint more subtle and transparent.                             |
| [Out of the Way Shield]   | Adjusts the standing and blocking shield models to take up less space on the screen. |
| [Silent Staring Enderman] | Removes the enderman staring noise by replacing it with silence.                     |
